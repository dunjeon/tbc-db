-- Removed wrong spawns of NPC 5890 (Redrock Earth Spirit) in Mulgore
-- There should be three small spirits in Durotar and Mulgore for the shaman quest "Call of the Earth".
-- There are only two each that are working as intended, plus three additional bugged ones in Mulgore. 
-- The bugged ones are visible to every class/race without having used the quest item.
-- This closes #870
