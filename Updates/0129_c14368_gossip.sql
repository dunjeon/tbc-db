-- The IDs for most of these menus and texts are unknown. Behaviour is based on http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Quest:Foror%27s_Compendium
-- The added texts are from Trinitycore broadcast_text IDs 9516-9527
-- Any unknown text or gossip ID has been assigned a number above 50k. Once sniffed IDs are found they should be replaced
-- This resolves the issue where a player would not be able to complete the Quel'Serrar questline. (After q.7507 you would be stuck and unable to acquire q.7508 due to the missing gossip)
